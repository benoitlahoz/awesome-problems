# Awesome Problems

An evolving documentation, based on experience, on how to solve a few problems as they arise. This repository is Typescript-oriented but, in the majority of cases, the code should be generally applicable with few modifications.

It is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to be a place to share small solutions to small problems that can sometimes take days to solve.
